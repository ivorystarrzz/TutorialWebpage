                <h3>Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and       forms the building blocks for modern
                    JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types (Number,
                    String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all
                    store a single value each (depending on their types). Objects are more complex and each object may
                    contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types. An object, is
                    a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a
                    pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object
                    is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value. Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may
                    be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form
                    of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and
                    methods, respectively, in the context of an object.</h3>

                <h3>Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to        perform traversal and mutation
                    operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. Since
                    an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the
                    array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses
                    to use them. In general, these are convenient characteristics; but if these features are not
                    desirable for your particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Arrays cannot use strings as element indexes (as in an associative array) but must use integers.
                    Setting or accessing via non-integers using bracket notation (or dot notation) will not set or
                    retrieve an element from the array list itself, but will set or access a variable associated with
                    that array's object property collection. The array's object properties and list of array elements
                    are separate, and the array's traversal and mutation operations cannot be applied to these named
                    properties.</h3>

                <h3>In any programming language, the code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly
                    depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then
                    it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic;
                    show stars and a moon if it is nighttime.</h3>

                    ("should I eat one cookie or two?") to large ("should I stay in my home country and work on my
                    father's farm, or should I move to America and study astrophysics?")</h3>

                    that must be made (for example, "one cookie or two"), to the resulting outcome of those choices
                    (perhaps the outcome of "ate one cookie" might be "still felt hungry", and the outcome of "ate two
                    cookies" might be "felt full, but mom scolded me for eating all the cookies".)</h3>

                    the case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a function is composed of a
                    sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function, and the
                    function will return a value</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just
                    like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called.
                    In brief, they are Function objects.</h3>

The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.</h3>
